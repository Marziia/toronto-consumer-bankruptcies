During the emergency, schools were closed, all non-essential travel was restricted and all non-essential commerce was shut-down.  As a result the TTC has been negatively affected and at its lowest point, ridership was down -85% and revenues down -87% per week. Starting in mid-May the Province, while still under a state of emergency, began to re-open certain segments of the economy. For the safety of both TTC customers and staff, various new guidelines like social distancing will restrict full ridership and revenue recovery for TTC until a more permanent solution like a vaccine is available."

During the emergency, schools were closed, all non-essential travel was restricted and all non-essential commerce was shut-down.  As a result the TTC has been negatively affected and at its lowest point, ridership was down -85% and revenues down -87% per week. Starting in mid-May the Province, while still under a state of emergency, began to re-open certain segments of the economy. For the safety of both TTC customers and staff, various new guidelines like social distancing will restrict full ridership and revenue recovery for TTC until a more permanent solution like a vaccine is available."

During the emergency, schools were closed, all non-essential travel was restricted and all non-essential commerce was shut-down.  As a result the TTC has been negatively affected and at its lowest point, ridership was down -85% and revenues down -87% per week. Starting in mid-May the Province, while still under a state of emergency, began to re-open certain segments of the economy. For the safety of both TTC customers and staff, various new guidelines like social distancing will restrict full ridership and revenue recovery for TTC until a more permanent solution like a vaccine is available."
